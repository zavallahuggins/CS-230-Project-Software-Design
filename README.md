# CS-230-Project-Software-Design

# Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

The client for this project was The Gaming Room. The Gaming Room develops games, one specifically being Draw It or Lose It, and they were wanting their game to be available on more platforms. The game was originally optimized for the Android platform but The Gaming Room wanted to expand to web-based platforms such as Mac, Windows, and Linux.

# What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

In developing this documentation, I believe I did the research particularly well. In the project, I was able to cover all topics asked due to research I did outside of the provided, in class, reading. 

# What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

Creating the design document as I developed the code helped by providing a template of what is needed from the project, what options I had, and what restrictions there were. 

# If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

If I could revise this document, I would do more in depth research about the development tools that could be used. I think my understanding of the tools was not as grounded as it could have been and has room for improvement. 

# How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

From the specifications provided from The Gaming Room, I created a user story that organized the priorities of what was needed in the design. It is important to consider the user's needs when designing because you will know what features to include and will not include extraneous, non-useful features.

# How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

I took an agile approach in designing the software. In the beginning stages of the project, I had created repitive classes. In another iteration of the code, I had implemented a parent class that gave inheritance to different child classes, making more re-usable, less repitive code. I think the concept of creating a rough outline, then reiterating it and refining the design as you go was most effective when designing this project.
